* The `Index` page.
* Typing hints improved, now `compas_viewer` only support Python 3.9+.
* Introduce decorator @lru_cache() to reduce duplicate calculations. 
* Refactored the `Selector` and the instance_map structure, the main frame rate is higher and selection action is faster.
* Fixed the bug of the `Selector`, drag selection is now more accurate.
* More performative instance map and QObject-based selection architecture.
* Naming of the keys, mouses, and modifiers are changed. The key string which is the same as what it was called in the PySide6.QtCore.Qt, with lowercases and with prefix&underscores removed.
